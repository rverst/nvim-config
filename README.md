# neovim config

This is my neovim configuration. It is a work in progress, and I am constantly tweaking it. 
I have tried to keep it as modular as possible, so that it is easy to add or remove plugins.

## Installation

To install the configuration, clone the repository to `~/.config/nvim`:
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/rverst/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

This repository is part of my [dotfiles](http://github.com/rverst/dotfiles)

## Thanks

This configuration is heavily inspired by the configurations of the following people (in alphabetical order):
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)
- [TjDevries](https://github.com/tjdevries)
- and probably other people
